If someone wants to use this — that's weird, I wouldn’t if I hadn’t written it myself.
But if you still want to, besides this warning, be aware: finite difference might be broken at the moment. I haven't fixed it since I shifted my focus to implementing a functional backpropagation system.
All the code has been written and tested on Fedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition), so that’s the environment where it’s expected to work best.
